# 800MHz
FCC First Responder App

Design Premise | History

FCC Spearheaded the reconfiguration of the 800 Mhz band in 2004 to prevent any disruptions specifically to First Responders. Although the frequency is not solely used by FR’s and the TSA, those two constituents constitute 95% of the users and aptly fill the role of UX Archetypes.

I created an App that would allow First Responders and other critical Infrastructure stakeholders to submit a complaint regarding excessive 800 traffic or other impediments.
This is an App, and can be scaled up to perform as a site, but, frankly, the FCC is the keeper of the 800 MHz flame, and as such, any of the FAQ, Mission, purpose, should be directed to the site from which this App would be downloaded.

With regards to the example site, I have the following observations:
not responsive
not mobile first
no call to action
complaint/logon/register too difficult
tragic body copy should be on FAQ not lander


Initial Redesign Thought Process

Was going to stick with tried and true design principles, use a face or an image of a first responder, but on reflection I realized this is (or should be) App for first responders, and they don’t need any fluffy “10 things Every Designer Should Know” crap.

The FCC has a lovely page for the GP where they can find out about their nuts and bolts. 

So the App should be a tool to lodge a complaint, as streamlined as possible based on a simple scenario. Big data is available to do most of the form processing either through TSA or FCC. I would invision , based on an authenticated user scenario, that the lat/lon and other pertinent data would auto-fill.
